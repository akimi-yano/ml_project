# Face Labo - Interactive Computer Vision 
## http://54.183.232.224/

A machine learning / computer vision web app that can count how many times a person blinks / winks or whether the person is sleepy from uploaded photos & videos.

• Applied computer vision techniques using OpenCV and NumPy and numerical calculations of dots 
placed on facial features to determine whether users are winking, sleepy, blinking, etc. 

• Realized interactive experience on a Python Django web app through a display of visual alert and image 
signaling in response to a triggered event to allow users to experience computer vision technology through exciting UI output
